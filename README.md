## Contents

* [`common`](common) provides infrastucture for creating plonk-like proofs.
* [`ring`](ring) for a vector commitment to a list of public keys, and a Pedersen commitment to one of the secret keys,
  implements a zk proof of knowledge of the blinding factor for the Pedersen commitment, and the position of the
  corresponding public key in the list.

## TODOs

* Fix FiatShamir:
    - add instance to the transcript,
    - verifier uses Fiat-Shamir rng to batch verify the pairings,
    - remove test_rng from not_test,
* Verifier evaluates selectors efficiently
* Find points from the prime-subgroup complements to seed the acc. How should it be encapsulated?
* Check paddings for the precommitted columns
* Refactor common/piop.rs to have types shared between prover nad verifier
* Add zk
* Batch verification
* Batch proving

## Building the Specification document

The specification is built by means of [Cargo spec](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-spec) crate. To build the specification document, oneneed pandoc and latex. With requirement installed, on can simply invoke:
```
$ make spec-build
```
and get the specification in `./spec/specification.pdf`
